## Identifying Musical Instruments in an Audio Recording with Recurrent Neural Networks

I originally used deep learning to recognize instruments in an audio file with [Dr. Andrew Ross](https://emunix.emich.edu/~aross15/). We did so by simulating 
the audio files, by mixing singular instrument notes, and modeled with a Recurrent Neural Network.

After my masters, I decided to update this project with my new knowledge and prospective. You can find this project (still in working) on my github account 
[here](https://github.com/brodyee/idMusicInstruments).

## Nielsen Consumer Research

Under [Dr. Robert Manduca](https://robertmanduca.com/), I analyzed the [nielsen consumer panel](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/nielsenIQ-nielsen) 
data. I did data cleaning, simply analysis, cload computing, dimension reduction, and clustering. With my finding, Dr. Manduca plans to write a (or some) papers.
