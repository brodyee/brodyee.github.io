I am currently a Statistic PhD canidate at Colorado State University, where I am doing (or hope to do) research in Bayesian Modeling, Probabilistic Machine Learning, and Causal Inference. I find particular interest in nonparametric Bayesian methods, and applying flexible bayesian methods to causal inference problems. I most interested in data and modeling related to medical, public health, psychology, and biological fields. I am trying to have a good mixture of computing and theoretical background. I love to dwell on theoretical and abstract structures, but also love to code and implement my ideas. I find it very important to pass on my knowledge to others, and encourage others to explore mathematics and statistics at a deeper level. I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Colorado State University, lab instructor at University of Michigan during my masters degree, and a part time instructor at Washtenaw Community College. Beyond academics, I love music, cooking, running, and enjoying nature!
