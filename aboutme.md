I am currently a Statistics PhD candidate at Colorado State University, where I am engaged in (or hope to engage in) research in Bayesian Modeling, Probabilistic Machine Learning, and Causal Inference. I have a particular interest in nonparametric Bayesian methods and in applying flexible Bayesian methods to causal inference problems. I am most interested in data and modeling related to medical, public health, psychology, and biological fields. I aim to maintain a good mixture of computing and theoretical background. I love to dwell on theoretical and abstract structures, but also love to code and implement my ideas. I find it very important to pass on my knowledge to others and encourage others to explore mathematics and statistics at a deeper level. I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Colorado State University, a lab instructor at the University of Michigan during my master's degree, and a part-time instructor at Washtenaw Community College. Beyond academics, I love music, cooking, running, and enjoying nature!
